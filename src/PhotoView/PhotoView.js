            <p className="cardDes">The most gratifying feeling in the world is taking a beautiful photo of someone and seeing it displayed prominently in their home. Seeing the world through a lens is what I have done my entire working career. I see the beauty in people and products and capture that beauty in a way that means something important to someone else. Using camera knowledge and logic, I am able to capture the beauty of just about any subject. It was this love of the visual that made me discover a deep rooted passion for the logical.</p>
            <p className="cardDes">I have photographed people from nearly every angle for the vast majority of my life. The ability to see people for who they are from behind a lens is something that I will never take for granted. This ability makes it possible for me to bond and conenct with people on an entirely new level of empathy and understanding. It's a gift that will always be a part of me.</p>

            <p className="cardDes">After several years of photographing people, I stumbled upon the art of product photography. I found myself in a job working as a Photoshop editor for a team of product photographers for an e-commerce company. Products can either come to life or die in a single photograph. In the digital world, a single photo can be the determining factor of whether a product sells or doesn't sell. It was this power that sent me straight into the arms of professional product photography.</p>
            <p className="cardDes">Product photography is what launched my side business into a full-time job. After building up a client base, I was soon able to open up a studio and start shooting product photos full time. I know the importance of great product photography and product storytelling. I also know the importance that those photos can have on a business' brand.</p>
