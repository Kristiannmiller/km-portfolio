  long_des: "An emotional experience application. Rume was born of an interest in creating a design specific app that helped an already emotionally conscious user do more than simply 'get past' or deescalate feelings, and rather create a 'space' that validates a user where they are at. We at Rume believe that it's just as important to take time and feel what you are feeling, as it is to know how to guide yourself back to peace and calm. A user can enter the site, choose an emotion to best suit their current state, and choose between journaling, feeling (ruminating through animation and sound), or follow a breathing exercise.",

  long_des: "Lyrical lies is made for the lyrically challenged people of the world. The people who belt out songs with confidence, but never actually know the lyrics finally have a place to confess their lyrical transgressions. A user can use the app to search for the song they know they sing the wrong lyrics to. A user can then anonymously post their misheard lyric for the world to see and laugh at mercilessly. The project focuses on key concepts including React, Router, and Asyncronous JavaScript. Robust unit and integration testing are also implemented for each component utilizing the Jest testing suite.",

Utilizing my newfound knowledge of Vanilla JavaScript, css, html, and dom manipulation (not to mention a neverending love for Adobe Photoshop), I created this application in 10 days after only 5 weeks of education. A goal of mine was to make the application responsive in mobile views. The goal was met, and the end result was regarded as a high understanding of the subject matter being evaluated.",

My goal with this site is to provide future/potential employers and contacts with up-to-date samples of my work and career aspirations. With UI/UX as a main focus, I built this app with React and kept the codebase relatively simple in order to be able to update quickly when needed without worrying about breaking changes. The site itself is a reflection of my personality and style. Feel free to contact me if anything on this site needs attention (sometimes we all need a little extra attention).",
