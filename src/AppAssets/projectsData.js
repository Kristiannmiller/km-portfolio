  long_des: "Like normal tic tac toe, but with a Jurassic Park twist. This was my initial end-of-mod project for Turing School of Software and Design's Front-End Engineering program. Utilizing my newfound knowledge of Vanilla JavaScript, css, html, and dom manipulation (not to mention a neverending love for Adobe Photoshop), I created this application in 10 days after only 5 weeks of education. A goal of mine was to make the application responsive in mobile views. The goal was met, and the end result was regarded as a high understanding of the subject matter being evaluated.",

  long_des: "This was a pair project assigned during the first week of the third module of the Front-End Program at the Turing School of Software and Design. We achieved full functionality of the project spec with only two weeks of exposure to React. The project reflects the functionality of familiar movie-rating applications. The application allows users to view movies fetched from an API, sign in and rate movies and leave comments on different movies of their choice. The learning goals of this project included cementing fundamental concepts of React including architecting a React application from scratch, implementing class and functional components and utilizing React Router for path transitions and displays. Robust unit and integration testing was also implemented for each component utilizing the Jest testing suite.",

  long_des: "Lyrical lies is made for the lyrically challenged people of the world. The people who belt out songs with confidence, but never actually know the lyrics finally have a place to confess their lyrical transgressions. A user can visit the site, search for the song they want to view the lyrics of. A user can then anonymously post their misheard lyric for the world to see and laugh at mercilessly. This is a Mod 3 final project for the Turing School of Software and Design's front-end program. The project focuses on key concepts learned throughout Module 3 of the front-end program. These key concepts include React, Router, and Asyncronous JavaScript. The overall goals of this project include demonstrating mastery of React, Router, and Asyncronous JavaScript. Robust unit and integration testing are also implemented for each component utilizing the Jest testing suite.",

  short_des: "A travel tracker and vacation price estimator",
  long_des: "This project is part of Turing Software and Designs' Front-End Program, Module 2. The project focuses on creating an application to manage and track different trips for users and a travel agency. The program is implemented with ES6 syntax and exclusively uses array-prototype methods whenever iterations need to be performed. There are no for loops used in the program. A Webpack starter-kit was provided, but all code and tests are written by the assigned developer. This program uses Object Oriented Programming to drive the design of the application and the code. This program focuses on working with an API to send and receive data (via fetch functions), the use of Sass alongside traditional css, and Mocha and Chai for testing class functions.",
